# Ecommerce Data to Business Insights

## Transforming Real-World Retail Transactions into Strategic Business Insights

This project is a data analysis and visualization project that uses a dataset of ecommerce transactions from 2011 to 2014. This project dives deep into the data to uncover hidden trends, consumer behaviors, and actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions. Every part of this project is designed to be a guide to help you understand how you can use raw information from your ecommerce transactions to make data-driven decisions. 

Using powerful tools in the Python ecosystem—including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly—we will clean, analyze, and visualize the data to tell a compelling story about the ecommerce landscape. This project serves not only as a deep-dive analysis but also as a practical guide for turning your raw data into actionable insights.
